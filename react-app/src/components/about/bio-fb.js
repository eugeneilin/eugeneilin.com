        <p class='lead text-center'>Get to know Eugene a little more.</p>
        <p class='about-p'>
          Eugene Ilin was born in 1996 in Chisinau, Moldova, into a family of
          musicians. From the young age of 3, he was taught by his father to
          play scales and simple melodies. Seeing their son's inclinations to
          music, his parents made it a point to always have a piano at home for
          the kids to practice on.
        </p>
        <p class='about-p'>
          Eugene's music environment growing up was influenced by his parents'
          music endeavors and tastes. His father is a classical saxophone
          player, who also plays a wide variety of other instruments, including
          brass, woodwind, guitar, keyboard, and percussion. For a period of
          time, Eugene's father headed his symphonic orchestra, after which he
          devoted most of his talents to choral conducting and music department
          development.

        <p class='about-p'>
          Eugene's mother (who actually taught Eugene his first song on the
          piano at the age of 6) is a lifelong violin-player and singer.
          Together, Eugene's parents were part of a recording studio since the
          end of the 80's.

              Having this background, Eugene discovered in himself a talent for
              effortlessly playing by ear and accompanying other musicians. From
              age 6, he was accompanying his Sunday school performances in
              church and grew to become one of the church's leading piano
              accompanists by age 15.

            <p class='about-p'>
              Eugene studied piano with private teachers from age 7, and joined
              the church's string ensemble as a pianist at 11, which pushed him
              to grow beyond his limits and motivated him to continue
              practicing.
            </p>
            <p class='about-p'>
              Eugene is a graduate of the IUC ECB Annual Music Institute where
              he studied voice, conducting, theory, and composition. Since 2014,
              Eugene has been actively teaching piano, theory, voice, and
              conducting throughout the country at various music workshops. He
              enjoys sharing the knowledge he gained with other talented
              musicians and encourages more musicians to grow in their craft.
            </p>
            <p class='about-p'>
              Today Eugene resides in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and leads the
              choir and the music department at his church.
            </p>
            <p class='about-p'>
              Eugene continues to advance himself in music, and aspires to do
              more of it and better for the good of others and to the glory of
              God!
